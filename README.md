# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project helps to understand why bank customers are leaving (churning) and how we can predict it using data analysis and machine learning.

---

## 📌 What is Churn?

Churn means a customer has **left the bank** and stopped using its services.

> Example: If a customer closes their bank account, they are called a **churned customer**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Analyze bank customer data using Python and SQL.
- Find patterns and reasons behind customer churn.
- Build a machine learning model to **predict which customer may leave**.
- Suggest ways to reduce customer churn.

## 📁 Files in This Project

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Churn_Modelling.csv` | Dataset with customer details |
| `Bank_Chrun_Analysis.sql` | SQL queries to get insights from data |
| `Bank_Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb` | Python notebook for EDA (graphs and summary) |
| `Churn_Predictive_Model.ipynb` | ML model to predict churn |

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python** – Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **SQL** – For writing queries
- **Jupyter Notebook** – To write and run code
- **HTML** – Final report format
- **Machine Learning Models** – Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.

---

## 📊 What Analysis Was Done?

- Age, Balance, Credit Score, Tenure, Gender, Geography, etc.
- Found customers who are more likely to leave.
- Found patterns like:
  - Customers with low tenure tend to churn.
  - People with active credit cards churn more.
  - Female customers in some regions churn more.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

- **Input:** Customer features like age, balance, tenure, etc.
- **Output:** Predicts if the customer will churn or not.
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 SQL Analysis

Used SQL to:
- Count total customers and churned customers.
- Analyze churn by geography and gender.
- Check average balance and salary of churned customers.

## 📌 How to Run This Project

1. Download all files.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the EDA notebook: `Bank_Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb`
4. Then run the ML model notebook: `Churn_Predictive_Model.ipynb`

## 📑 Insights from the Project

- Younger customers and low tenure customers churn more.
- Customers without credit cards churn less.
- Better service and offers can reduce churn rate.
